### Key Architectural Decisions

**Mobile-First Approach**: The entire application is designed exclusively for mobile devices, with a maximum width container and touch-optimized interactions. This decision was made to focus on the primary use case and ensure optimal mobile experience.

**Server-Side Data Persistence**: All user data is stored server-side with proper authentication, avoiding local storage dependencies. This ensures data synchronization across devices and prevents data loss.

**Component-Based Architecture**: Modular React components with clear separation of concerns, reusable UI components, and consistent design patterns throughout the application.

**Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation across frontend, backend, and shared schemas ensures compile-time error catching and better developer experience.

**Performance Optimization**: TanStack Query provides intelligent caching, background updates, and optimistic updates for smooth user experience with minimal loading states.

**Preloaded Data Structure**: The application includes comprehensive preloaded workout routines, development goals, and productivity templates that users can customize, providing immediate value without empty state friction.
