Meta Build – Replit AI Full Prompt  
(Personal Mobile-Only Productivity & Progress Tracker)

Build a modern, full-stack webapp called "Meta Build" for me, as my personal all-in-one productivity companion.  
This webapp must be designed ONLY for mobile devices first (no desktop version), with a world-class, simple, and clean UI, and only minimal necessary animations/effects (clarity/smoothness prioritized).  
All user data (tasks, workout, routines, dev progress, etc.) MUST be saved to a secure backend server and synched -- do NOT use local storage only.

**Handle ALL features, pages, design, backend, testing, and polish in one go:**  
- Implement and test every requirement, state, and user action until the app works 100% perfectly and feels like it was built by a top 1% developer.
- Do not ask iterative questions – parse and deliver ALL needs in one complete codebase.
- Build the entire UI/UX, logic, state, backend, and sample data as directed.
- Preload all my provided routines, plans, and dev goals (see below!) into the app as default/user-editable data.

---

Pages & Features:

1. **Daily Task Page**
   - Top: Pie chart showing today’s task progress.
   - Right/top: Water intake (pie chart or simple tracker).
   - Floating "+" button to add tasks (modal or input popup).
   - Tasks: tap to reveal three-dot menu (edit/delete).

2. **Workout Page**
   - Top: Pie chart of today’s workout performance.
   - Tabs: "Daily Workout" | "Weekly Workout"
     - Daily: See and complete daily workouts (show name, reps/sets, with three-dots for actions). Preload my custom routines.
     - Weekly: Tabs for each day; can view/complete current or other days. Missed workouts flagged separately.
   - "+" button: Add Workout Type (choose weekly/daily, name, max time) or Add Workout (assign to day/type, multiple at once).
   - *Default plans must include my full routine and grip plan (see below).*

3. **Mind Workout Page**
   - Top: Pie chart for today’s completed mind exercises.
   - Loaded with my mental exercises schedule—edit/delete and add new via "+".
   - Tasks: Tapping shows edit/delete options.

4. **Daily Routine Page**
   - Sections: Morning, Night, and Weekly routines (switchable, sticky header, or segmented tabs).
   - Pie chart of routine completion for the day.

   - All hygiene, hair, skin plans below must be built-in as editable templates!

5. **Dev Progress Page**
   - Visual progress bar/tracker for my weekly, monthly and yearly dev goals/milestones.
   - Check off weekly items, which auto-completes higher-level milestones.
   - Prompts for end-of-week/month/year review.
   - All content must come pre-filled with my provided 2025-2030 trajectory, current year roadmap, and my daily dev routine checklist (see below).

6. **Dashboard (Home) Page**
   - Top: Streaks (current/highest).
   - Bar graph: Today’s overall performance (tasks, workout, mind, routine, dev).
   - Monthly calendar: color-coded for daily performance (finalizes at 12:01am), click day to show breakdown.
   - More/month navigation; mini bar-chart for any day on click.
   - Weekly summary and dev progress recaps below.
   - All navigation, graphs, and buttons mobile-optimized, thumb-friendly.

**Design/UI**
- Only mobile–first views, NO desktop.
- Clean, minimal, distraction-free. Only essential visual effects and feedback.
- Consistent color palette, typography, and simple cards/containers for easy readability.
- All buttons, charts, menus, modals – 1-tap, fast, no lag, clear feedback.
- Accessibility: test contrast/interactions.

**Data & Backend**
- Save all user data to backend server.  
- Allow auto-sync for seamless usage over many days/weeks.

**Testing**
- Confirm EVERY page, action, and state works on first build (no waiting for user feedback).
- Run all tests for UI, state, data, edge cases – refactor for maintainability and stability.
- Ship code "ready for the real world," clean and elite.
